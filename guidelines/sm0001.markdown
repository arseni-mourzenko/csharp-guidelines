# SM0001 Do not repeat the same type twice during initialization

When a variable is declared and initialized at the same time, do not repeat the type if it is the same.

## Example

Don't do that:

```csharp
Square s = new Square();
```

Instead, do:

```csharp
var s = new Square();
```

or:

```csharp
Square s = new();
```

## Reasons

**1.** There is no need to repeat stuff when it doesn't bring any benefit.

**2.** The common practice is to specify the type of the variable *and* the type after `new` when those types differ. Example:

```csharp
Shape s = new Square(point, size);
```

Here, the variable `s` would later be treated as a shape, without actually knowing if it's a square, a rectangle, a circle, etc. The difference between the two types can be subtle. For instance, in the following example, it's just one letter difference:

```csharp
IContainedTransaction t = new ContainedTransaction();
```

Therefore, when encountering a piece of code which specifies the type of the variable and the type after `new`, one would believe that those types are different. If the types are actually the same, the reader would waste a few seconds glancing at the code, trying to understand what's happening. It's like if the code was shouting: “hey, be very careful, don't miss the... well, actually, no, there is nothing here to look about.”
