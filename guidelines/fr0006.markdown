# FR0006 Do not use visually ambiguous glyphs as names.

Avoid using glyphs that could be mistaken for other ones in one-letter names of variables.

Depending on the fonts:

 - A lowercase l can look as the digit 1 or a capital I.
 - A capital O can look as the digit 0.

## Example

Don't do that:

```csharp
return lengths.Where(l => l > 0);
```

Instead, do:

```csharp
return lengths.Where(length => length > 0);
```

or:

```csharp
return lengths.Where(x => x > 0);
```

## Reasons

**1.** Don't make code more difficult to read than it needs to be. While in general, it *is* possible to disambiguate a character with further inspection, it is much more practical to avoid such inspection in the first place.

**2.** Cases where `l` for a variable (instead of a generic `x`) makes sense are pretty rare. The same goes for `I` and `O` for constants.
