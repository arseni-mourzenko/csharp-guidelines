# FR0004â€‚Don't cut words for variable names in the middle.

I'm sure you don't enjo readin text that has lette missin, becau someon was lazy enou to writ the comple words.

Well, this applies to the names of variables as well.

A commission, for instance, is a `commission`. Not a `commis` and not a `comm` or `com`. The entire form is clear and to the point. Words cut in the middle are, on the other hand, unclear and error prone. Is `com` referring to commission, or communication, commander, or compiler? No way to know.
