# SM0003 Do not use leading zeros in numbers

When using numeric values in code, do not prefix them with one or multiple zeros, including when specifying dates.

## Example

Don't do that:

```csharp
var birthday = new DateOnly(1985, 04, 09);
```

Instead, do:

```csharp
var birthday = new DateOnly(1985, 4, 9);
```

## Reasons

**1.** Those zeros don't add anything useful to the code.

**2.** Some languages, such as JavaScript, don't just ignore leading zeros, but sometimes use them as an indication that the number is using octal notation. For instance, executing `072 + 1` in a browser console would produce 59, not 73.
