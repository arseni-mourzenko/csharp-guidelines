# SM0008 Do not compare with `true` or `false`

In conditionals, do not write that a given value is equal to `true`, or that a given value is equal or different from `false`.

## Example

Don't do that:

```csharp
if (address.isValid == true)
```

or:

```csharp
if (requestFailed != false)
```

or:

```csharp
if (collection.Any() == false)
```

Instead, do:

```csharp
if (address.isValid)
```

and:

```csharp
if (!requestFailed)
```

and:

```csharp
if (!collection.Any())
```

## Reasons

**1.** Explicit presence of `true` and `false` in this context is distracting.

**2.** Such code being usually written by very inexperienced programmers, it presents a stylistic distraction.

## Exceptions

Occasionnally, code can be made clearer when using constants for boolean values in a specific domain. For example, a state of a switch can be represented as a boolean value, but to give it a meaning, two constants can be introduced:

```csharp
const bool On = true;
const bool Off = false;
```

Then, those constants can be used explicitly in conditionals to make things clearer:

```csharp
if (LightSwitch.State == Off)
```

This is clearer compared to `if (!LightSwitch.State)`, as the constant adds a bit more domain context. However, sometimes such code can be rewritten by not using a boolean in the first place, or by introducing explicit and clear properties. The previous example could be rewritten as:

```csharp
if (LightSwitch.IsOff)
```

which is shorter to write and perfectly clear.
