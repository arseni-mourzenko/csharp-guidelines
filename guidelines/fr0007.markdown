# FR0007 Limit the usage of non-ASCII characters in names.

Avoid using Unicode (non-ASCII) characters in the names of members. This is especially true when there can be a confusion between those Unicode glyphs and some ASCII characters, such as the Greek gamma “γ” and the letter “y.”

## Example

Don't do that:

```csharp
var γ = 0.577215664901;
```

or:

```csharp
lens.𝑓 = 2.8;
```

Instead, do:

```csharp
const double Euler = 0.577215664901;
```

and:

```csharp
lens.Aperture = 2.8;
```

## Reasons

**1.** Lots of people may be confused about such characters, and even more won't know how to write them, resorting to a tedious copy and paste.

**2.** Intellisense and autocompletion may become less intuitive to use. For instance, you need to access a property *Δ*, that represents a difference. What exactly do you type? Or if you have an alphabetical list of properties, should you expect *Δ* to appear above or below the Latin characters?

**3.** Some editors may not show Unicode characters correctly. At the moment of writing, for instance, Visual Studio Code under Linux renders `lens.𝑓` from the example above in a way that can only be qualified as abomination:

**4.** Rules related to small vs. capital letters may not play well with Unicode characters. Taking the example above, should one write `const double γ = 0.577215664901;`, messing with the rule that constants should start with a capital letter, or switch to `const double Γ = 0.577215664901;`, forgetting the Euler's constant is not *Γ*, but *γ*?

**5.** Typographic rules don't play well with source code. For instance, Euler's constant is not γ, but italic *γ*, so for the sake of correctness, it should be written `𝛾` in code. But now you have one more problem. It's already too difficult to use `γ`, and `γ` vs. `𝛾` only adds to the confusion.

## Limits

If an Unicode character is at the end of a name, rather than at the beginning, it won't mess up with Intellisense and programmers won't necessarily have to type it. If it is not visually ambiguious and is commonly used in a given domain, it *might* be justifiable to use it.
